# Environmental Changes caused by COVID-19 and the Associated Societal Responses: A Review 

This  study  entailed  a  review  of  environmental  changes  caused  by  COVID-19  and  the  associated 
societal responses. The topic itself describes the effect of COVID-19 on Air quality, Deforestation, Wildfires 
& urbanization. It includes the use case of both statistical data and satellite data for getting the impact of 
the  COVID-19  pandemic.
